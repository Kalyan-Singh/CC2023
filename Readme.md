## Connected Tournaments

### Description 
We are building a Tournament hosting and match making platform, where organizers can organize tournaments and forget about the headache of match making and payouts. Also players can use cyberconnect social graph to find like minded players to team up with and register to take part in tournaments.

Also our smart contracts are completely modular. Organizers and community can build their own matchmaking modules,as there are almost infinite ways to do matchmaking in games, such that the module fits their needs, while still using our payouts and all the tournament moderation features.

### Problems We Solve
1.  Our match making modules make matches in a provably random and fair way completely on chain.
    
2.  No need to keep switching hosting platforms if our matchmaking module does not satisfy you, use another module, while still keeping your organization’s community intact and asking all your user to register again on another platform.
    
3.  Instant Payouts. Our escrow contract sends instant payout to the winners as soon as a tournament has concluded.
    
4.  We support live streaming of matches thanks to livepeer.
    
5.  Participants can connect with fellow like minded players using cyberconnect.
